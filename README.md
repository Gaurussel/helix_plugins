 - cl_charload: ModernUI cl_charload reworked to work on all screens (I know that the code can be done better, but I'm in the shit)
 - entity_givers: In general, wild bullshit, I don't know why they ordered this. People from the table in sh_plugin can interact with entities that give things.
 - bank: A simple bank with a custom interface. Deposit, take, transfer money.
